Requirements for an international technology cooperation network:

International Cooperation Network by Research Direction: The network should be able to display different layers including nations, institutions, and individuals, with each analysis considering paper contribution as an optional parameter.

Overview of a Country's International Cooperation: This includes key institutions, individuals, and research directions involved in international collaborations for a specific country.

Bilateral Cooperation Details: This should cover the essential details of cooperation between two specific countries, including major institutions, key personnel, and research directions.

Multinational Cooperation Overview: For groups of countries, such as the BRICS nations, the system should detail the major institutions, notable individuals, and research directions involved in their cooperative efforts.

Data Sources: The sources for this data should not be limited to CNS and its subsidiaries, but rather should be extensive enough to meet practical needs.

Visualization and Data Representation: Alongside visual displays of the networks, corresponding data lists should also be presented.

Localization and Database Updates: The data sources and functional modules should be capable of localization, with database updates to reflect professional English terminology.
